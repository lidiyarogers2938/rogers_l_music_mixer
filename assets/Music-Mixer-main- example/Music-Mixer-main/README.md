# Checkpoint 2 - Music Mixer

# Assignment Description
The checkpoint is a way to report to your Studio Managers (your teaching team - which is just
me for now) your current progress / how you intend to continue to implement your strategy for
your assignments. For the Authoring class, I expect to see the following:


# Detailed Requirements
1. Github repos set up for each project with team access (both members contributing).
Readme should be updated / done; any instructions should be in place.
2. Drag and drop functionality should be done (doesn’t have to be perfect) Audio should
play on a drop (doesn’t have to be perfect). Audio tracks should be layered / however
your project “works” should be roughly finished
3. Design should be 75 - 80% done; any FPO artwork should be removed.
4. Dev / design notes / bug reports for the project (what’s breaking, research into how to fix
bugs, etc… any design improvements that need to be made)
