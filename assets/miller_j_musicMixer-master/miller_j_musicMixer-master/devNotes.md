# Concept: Drag and Drop Looping Music Web Page

Create a web page featuring a robot with draggable “buttons” that when dragged onto the robot play looping music and ultimately can form a customizable song. There will be a button holder on the left and the robot on the right. The robot will have places or holes for input. 

## Feature Breakdown:

• User drags one of the buttons from the holder and onto the drop zones of the robot.

• Each button will feature a different musical loop that will be timed appropriately 

• Each button will have a grayscale filter while on the holder, and will “light up” as they’re dropped on to the robot.

• Stop all music feature? 

• Volume slider?

## Components to be considered:

• Need to be able to drag and drop the svg buttons from the holder to the robot

• Div zones for both holder and robot.

• Buttons dropped on other buttons need to replace them and return the button to the holder

• Music looping needs to be figured out (add audio via JS?)

• Add timing for each loop so it starts at the same time.
